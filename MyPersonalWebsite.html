          <h2>Bio</h2>

          <p>I am an enthusiastic Software Engineering Student looking to kickstart a career in the
          technology industry using attention to detail, quick learning and problem-solving skills.
          I have experience developing complex programs using Python, clear understanding of Object-Oriented programming,
          experience in HTTP network fundamentals and a great foundation using NLP.
          <br>
          While working as a Shift Leader at Tesco between 2019-2022 I developed my leadership, team work and
          time management skills. I would oversee various daily routines carried out by myself and the team,
          including payroll, implementing change to prevent losses, tracking the stores trade and improving the customers
          shopping experience. While the store manager was away it was my role to oversee the store, drive the team
          and make sure all processes were complete.
          </p>
